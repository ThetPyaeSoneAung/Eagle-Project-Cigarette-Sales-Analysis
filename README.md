Objective :
The project aims to analyze sales data for different cigarette brands to identify the best-selling products and provide insights for informed business decisions. This involves examining weekly sales figures, pricing strategies, and purchase volumes for various brands.


Data Analysis and Findings:
          
          •	JTI products dominate across all outlets, with approximately 50% of owners purchasing from sales vans and 30% from wholesalers.
          
          •	According to survey data, DF Dunhill and Marlboro (all SKUs) are identified as the highest margin products in the market, indicating robust profitability compared to other products.
          
          •	The purchasing and selling prices of JTI brands have shown stability in the market, suggesting consistent pricing strategies and market acceptance.
          
          •	Consumers show a clear preference for purchasing 4 bundles across the top 5 brands, indicating a strong market preference for bundle purchases over other packaging options.
          
          •	Approximately 80% of sales in stick format are observed in Mevius and Red Ruby brands, whereas Premium Gold is predominantly preferred in pack format.
          
          •	JTI Mevius Original Blue holds the top spot across all outlets, but its dominance weakens in general trade stores (where JTI Mevius Kiwami takes the crown) and horeca outlets (where VTC Red Ruby reigns supreme). 
          
          •	This suggests that smokers frequenting different outlets have distinct preferences, highlighting the need for targeted marketing strategies by brands.

Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, the recommendations are to focus on top-selling products, optimize pricing strategy, enhance bundle offers, and monitor purchase patterns.

Conclusion:
The project provides valuable insights into the sales performance of various cigarette brands, enabling the client to make informed decisions to enhance product offerings, optimize pricing, and improve overall business performance.
